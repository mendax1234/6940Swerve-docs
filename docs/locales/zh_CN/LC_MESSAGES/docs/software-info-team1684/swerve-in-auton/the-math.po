"One of the core differences when operating in autonomous mode is that the "
"robot can't receive information about where it is from the driver, in the "
"form of controls. Early on, we established that we want to accurately and "
"repeatably control our movements and actions. To do this, the robot needs to"
" know where it is at all times - or at least have a good guess. This is "
"known as `odometry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry>`_ within the "
"field of robotics. Without accurate odometry, we're forced to use `dead "
"reckoning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning>`_ , or worse, time-"
"based movements at approximate speeds."

"自动模式下的移动与手动模式下最核心的区别就在于自动模式下的机器人不能从driver那里获得任何信息。因此，为了可以精确地并且重复地控制机器人的移动与动作，机器人需要知道它在赛场的何方——或者至少有个大概的猜测。这一过程在机器人的领域中被称为"
"  `odometry "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry>`_。如果没有办法精确地预测机器人的位置，我们就智能被迫采用 `dead"

"In order to perform our odometry, we decided to use our wheel encoders "
"combined with a gyroscope. By performing the reverse of what we do in "
"teleop, which is taking an intended output pose and figuring out what each "
"individual actuator should be doing to achieve that pose. Again, a pose is "
"simply a set of unique characteristics describing the robot's position or "
"motion at an instant in time. By taking information about the velocity and "
"direction of each wheel and combining it using the kinematics we described "
"in section 2.1, we can obtain an overall velocity of the robot in two "

"When you add the change every cycle, you always know where that wheel is. "
"The same is done for the other 3 wheels. We use that information to find the"
" center of the robot. The direction that the robot is facing could also be "
"determined in the same manner, but we chose to use our gyros for that. We "
"only store the current position of the center of the robot. We do , however,"
" send that position to the dashboard and record the data there. We are able "
"to graph out the position that the robot reported and impose it over a map "
"of the field to allow us to make improvements to our autons even without "
"having access to the robot."

"当你在每个周期添加变化时，你总是知道某个轮子的位置，对另外3个也是。我们用这些信息来定位机器人的中心。机器人的方向也可以用同样的方式来确定，但我们选择用我们的陀螺仪来做这个。我们只存储机器人中心的当前位置。我们将该位置发送到Dashboard，并在那里记录数据。我们能够据此绘制出机器人的位置图，并将其画在在场地地图上，使我们能够在不接触机器人的情况下对我们的自动进行改进。"

"The next part of the puzzle is to tell the robot where to go next. We "
"reverse the tracking process to instruct each wheel on where to go next. We "
"input the desired x,y coordinate into the subroutine. The angle that each "
"wheel needs to face is calculated. The angle will be the same for all wheels"
" unless the robot is going to spin while moving. If the robot will be "
"changing heading while moving, the amount of turn correction will be "
"factored in causing the wheels to face different directions and have "
"different relative speeds until the spin portion is achieved. We use a "
"positioning loop to assign the wheel speed. We are only using kP * error. We"
" can change states by several different criteria. We might use an achieved "
"distance, an intake sensor, or a targeting feedback to tell the robot that "
"it is done with that task. The robot then moves on to the next task."

"下一个问题是告诉机器人接下来要怎么走。我们把跟踪过程倒过来，告诉每个轮子下一步要去哪里。我们在子系统中输入所需的x、y坐标。每个轮子需要面对的角度被计算出来。除非机器人在移动时要旋转，否则所有车轮的角度都是一样的。如果机器人将在移动中改变航向，那么转弯修正量将被计入，并使得车轮面对不同的方向，并有不同的相对速度，直到实现旋转部分。我们使用一个定位循环来分配车轮的速度。我们只使用kP*误差。我们可以通过几个不同的标准来改变状态。我们可能会使用已实现的距离、intake传感器或瞄准反馈来告诉机器人，它已经完成了该任务。然后，机器人就会转到下一个任务。"

"If we used our nominal wheel diameters and gear ratios, these values should "
"be pretty close to real-world values, but they probably won't be perfect. "
"We'll want to calibrate our overall speeds by applying a multiplier. This "
"calibration can be as simple as marking off a set distance (the longer the "
"better) and driving the robot across this distance, keeping it as straight "
"as possible. Once the distance is reached, the reported distance value can "
"be compared with the actual distance value and ratioed to produce a "
"correction factor - actual distance over reported distance. This can also be"
" used to account for wheel wear, which changes the effective wheel diameter "
"and can cause inaccurate distance measurements when not accounted for."

"如果我们使用我们的理想车轮直径和齿轮比，这些数值应该非常接近真实世界的数值，但它们可能并不完美。我们要通过乘上一个常数来校准我们的整体速度。这种校准可以很简单，就是标出一个设定的距离（越长越好），然后驾驶机器人穿过这个距离，尽可能保持直线。一旦达到这个距离，就可以将报告的距离值与实际距离值进行比较，并将其比值产生一个修正系数"
"--实际距离大于报告距离。这也可以用来计算车轮的磨损，车轮的磨损会改变有效的车轮直径，如果不计算在内，会导致距离测量不准确。"
