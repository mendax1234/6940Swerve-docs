"Our choice for motor controllers for the swerve modules was the `Falcon 500 "
"<https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-6515.html>`_ with the integrated brushless "
"motor by VEX Robotics and the Talon FX controller by CTRE. The reason for "
"using this as the drive motor was simple, power and control. The integrated "
"encoder is adequate for counting the distance travelled using the velocity "
"mode to get the most consistent results regardless of voltage differences "
"(within reason.)"

"The turning motor is `775 pro <https://www.vexrobotics.com/775pro.html>`_ by"
" VEX Robotics and the `Talon SRX "
"<https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-8080.html>`_ controller by CTRE. The reason"
" for using this is that the swerve is designed to use a 775 pro as its "
"turning motor. Another reason is that we don't have enough Falcon 500 and we"
" want to make full use of them. For example, use them on our shooter and "
"intaker."

"The Limelight is used to visually target the goal. We use the x and y "
"offsets that are in the Limelight to turn the shooter to the goal and gauge "
"the distance from the goal. The Limelight has excellent range and is able to"
" target the goal from anywhere on the field that has a shooting solution. "
"The Limelight is mounted in front of our shooter. With the interpoltion "
"table, we can achieve shooting at every place in the field with the help of "
"Limelight2+."

"The Pixy2 is also a visual targeting camera and processor, but due to the "
"color ofthis season's (2022 Season Rapid React) cargo (blue and red), Pixy2 "
"may not be able tell the difference between team's bumper and the cargo, so "
"l am sorry to say that Pixy2 may not be able to be used as a camera to do "
"game-piece centric. But we will also introduce the game-piece centric in the"
" later chapters with Pixy2."
