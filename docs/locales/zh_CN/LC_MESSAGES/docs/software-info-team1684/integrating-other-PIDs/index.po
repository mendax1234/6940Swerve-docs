"Let's get down to business. Swerve enables such freedom of motion, it's a "
"waste to not utilize it for your advantage as much as possible. If done "
"successfully, your robot will perform at a new level."
msgstr ""
"让我们进入整体。Swerve实现了如此自由的运动，如果不尽可能地利用它的优势，那就是一种浪费。而如果你做得成功，你的机器人将达到一个新的高度。"

"Not convinced yet? Think about it this way. The more control the driver has,"
" the more natural driving will feel. The more comfortable the driver is, the"
" better they will play. The better they play, the better your whole team "
"will do. That is why we are so hard-set on having solid controls. We want to"
" perform well. And we want you to as well."
msgstr ""
"还不相信吗？这样想一想吧。driver的控制力越强，开机器的感觉就越自然。driver越舒服，他们就会打得越好。他们打得越好，你的整个团队就会做得越好。这就是为什么我们对拥有坚实的控制力如此执着。我们希望有好的表现。我们希望你也能如此。"
