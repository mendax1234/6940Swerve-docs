"We want to tell the robot to go to a coordinate on the field and face a "
"specific direction when it gets there. Sometimes we want the rotation to "
"happen at different places along the route. Sometimes we want it to rotate "
"first or last. Sometimes we even want the robot to travel around an "
"obstacle. The robot should switch modes as desired along the overall route "
"to achieve the game objectives. We used a case generator to give us each "
"motion in the desired order and change states primarily by sensors. The end "
"result should be a robot that travels at the maximum controllable speed "
"while achieving the desired positions with maximum accuracy."

"我们希望让机器人走到场地上的一个位置并面向一个特定的方向。有时，我们希望旋转在路径上的不同的地方发生。有时，我们又希望机器在一开始或者在最后就旋转。有时，我们甚至希望机器在障碍间穿梭。机器应当按照我们的需求在路径间切换其模式来获得得分物。我们用一个case"
" "
"generator来给我们提供每个动作的理想顺序，并主要通过传感器来改变状态。最终的结果应该是一个机器人以最大的可控速度行驶，同时以最大的精度到达所需的位置。"
