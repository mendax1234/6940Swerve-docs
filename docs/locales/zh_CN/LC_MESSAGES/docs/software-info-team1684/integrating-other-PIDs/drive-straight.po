"Driving “straight” isn't as easy as you thought, is it? When we say "
"“straight”, we mean moving without unintentionally turning. We've all been "
"there: “why is the robot steering left/right even though I'm telling it to "
"drive straight!?!” This is something we struggled with for a while too. "
"Unfortunately, there will always be physical variances between individual "
"wheels or two sides of a drivetrain. There will always be a need for a drive"
" “straight” PID ."
msgstr ""
" \"走直线\"并不像你想象的那么容易，是吗？当我们说 \"直行 "
"\"时，我们的意思是机器在移动时不会无意地转向。我们都经历过这种情况。\"为什么我告诉它要直线行驶，它却向左或向右转向！？\" "
"这也是困扰了我们很久的事情。不幸的是，单个车轮或传动系统的两边之间总是存在物理差异。这也是为什么我们总是需要一个驱动 \"直行 \"的PID。"

"When it comes to swerve, driving “straight” is more complicated. Instead of "
"the robot driving forward/backward at a specific heading/angle , we want the"
" robot to move in any direction without spinning. The robot should always "
"stay facing the same way, unless we tell it to rotate. When it rotates, that"
" angle will be our new heading to maintain."
msgstr ""
"而当我们采用矢量底盘时，“直走”变得更加复杂。我们希望机器人不只是前后行走，我们希望它能够在任意一个方向上都毫无偏移地直走。机器人应该总是面向同一个方向，除非我们让它旋转。当它旋转后，它的新的朝向也应当被正确地保持。"

"Now things get even more interesting. How do we do this when we have other "
"PID loops (i.e. goal centric , game piece centric ) occurring "
"simultaneously? The robot should switch between goal centric, game piece "
"centric, and field centric seamlessly."
msgstr ""
"现在事情就变得有趣起来了。既然我们已经有了其他的PID进程（即：以玩家朝向为原点，以得分框为原点），我们该如何保证机器在以得分框为原点，以场地为原点和以玩家朝向为原点之间无缝切换呢？"

"Essentially, we want to keep facing the same angle whenever we aren't "
