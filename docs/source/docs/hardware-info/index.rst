About Our Swerve Modules
-------------------------

We are using the MK5 swerve modules from SJTU.

About Our Gyros
----------------

We use one gyro on our robot. The `Gadgeteer Pigeon IMU <https://store.ctr-electronics.com/gadgeteer-pigeon-imu/>`_ from Cross the Road Electronics (CTRE)
We have also test `NavX-MXP <https://pdocs.kauailabs.com/navx-mxp/>`_ on our robot and it works well.

About Our Motor Controllers
----------------------------

Our choice for motor controllers for the swerve modules was the `Falcon 500 <https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-6515.html>`_ with the integrated
brushless motor by VEX Robotics and the Talon FX controller by CTRE. The reason for using this as
the drive motor was simple, power and control. The integrated encoder is adequate for counting the
distance travelled using the velocity mode to get the most consistent results regardless of voltage
differences (within reason.)

The turning motor is `775 pro <https://www.vexrobotics.com/775pro.html>`_ by VEX Robotics
and the `Talon SRX <https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-8080.html>`_ controller by CTRE.
The reason for using this is that the swerve is designed to use a 775 pro as its turning motor.
Another reason is that we don't have enough Falcon 500 and we want to make full use of them. 
For example, use them on our shooter and intaker.
