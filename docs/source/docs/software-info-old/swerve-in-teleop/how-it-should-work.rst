How It Should Work
====================
You move the controller and the robot magically does what you think it should. Isn't that the goal?
Of course it is! The way that we chose is the same way that our driver would operate a drone.
Although, we have not worked out the levitate functionality.

The robot should be free to move in any direction on the single plane of the field. It should be able to
do that at the same speed and torque.

Given the extra freedom that swerve gives the robot, both literally and in terms of holonomic
movement (can freely move in any direction, ideally with no preferred direction), operating in a
field-centric manner is immensely helpful. We consider field-centric motion essential to utilizing
swerve effectively at a competition level.
