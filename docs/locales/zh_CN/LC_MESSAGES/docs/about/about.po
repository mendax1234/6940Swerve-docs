"We DON'T want to deter you from achieving your dream machine. We DO want to "
"limit the number of broken-down robots on the field. As FRC Team 1684's "
"drive coach Jon Uren says, “Build within your means.” If your team doesn't "
"meet all the requirements listed above, please reconsider attempting to do "
"swerve. Poorly implemented swerve (in both a programming and mechanical "
"sense) will do your team a major disservice. Sure, that robot might look "
"cool or sound epic. But, does it work!? Most of the time, the simpler the "
"better."
msgstr ""
"我们不希望阻止你实现你的梦想机器。我们确实希望限制场上破损机器人的数量。正如FRC  Team 1684的驾驶教练Jon "
"Uren所说，\"量力而行\"。如果你的团队不符合上述所有要求，请重新考虑尝试做swerve。拙劣的swerve（在编程和机械意义上）将给你的团队带来重大损失。当然，那个机器人可能看起来很酷或听起来很厉害。但是，它有用吗？大多数情况下，越简单越好。"

"We all know that time on the robot is limited. Programmers always wish for "
"more time on the finished robot. Time is the most valuable build season "
"commodity. Before something does not go as planned, it should be part of "
"your programming strategy to know when to reach out for help. Help can mean "
"looking for sample code, asking on a forum if someone has had a similar "
"issue, or even reaching out to other teams to review your code. Remember "
"that other FRC programmers will likely be in the same semi-frantic state "
"that you are trying to figure out the one thing that isn't working. Someone "
"outside of your programming team may not have the time to help you. Asking "
"for another team's time during build season is a BIG ASK!"

"我们都知道搭建机器人的时间是有限的。程序员往往希望花更多的时间在最终的机器上。在搭建期，时间是最有价值的。在某个部件没有按正常情况工作时，知道什么时候寻求帮助，是你程序策略的一部分。“帮助”可以是寻找样例代码，在论坛上询问是否有人遇到了相同的问题，或者向其他队伍求助，询问他们是否能帮你查看代码。请记住，当FRC程序员无法确定哪一个部分没有正常工作时，他们可能和你一样处于一个半疯狂的状态。非程序组的人可能没有时间去帮你。所以在搭建期向另一支队伍求助很重要！"
