Integrating Other PIDs into Swerve
====================================
Swerve is really cool on its own, but you know what’s even better? MORE FLEXIBLE CONTROLS!
“But isn’t field-centric good enough?” some may ask.
In return we ask, ”Do you want to be the very best that no one ever was?”

Let’s get down to business. Swerve enables such freedom of motion, it's a waste to not utilize it for
your advantage as much as possible. If done successfully, your robot will perform at a new level.

Not convinced yet? Think about it this way. The more control the driver has, the more natural
driving will feel. The more comfortable the driver is, the better they will play. The better they play,
the better your whole team will do. That is why we are so hard-set on having solid controls. We want
to perform well. And we want you to as well.
