"In game piece centric, the rotate input from the joystick is overridden by "
"the Pixy. The driver is free to move the robot in any direction while the "
"Pixy keeps the robot pointed at a ball. This makes picking up balls on the "
"far side of the field a little easier. Since we have a Pixy on the front "
"intake and the rear intake, the driver has to select which one to use for "
"this mode."
msgstr ""
"当我们瞄准得分物时，操纵杆的旋转输入被Pixy覆盖。驾驶员可以自由地将机器人向任何方向移动，而Pixy则保持机器人对准一个球。这使得在场地远处捡球变得更加容易。由于我们在前面的进气口和后面的进气口都有一个Pixy，所以驾驶员必须选择在这种模式下使用哪一个。"

"There are two signals that we receive from the Pixy. There is a digital "
"signal that tells us if a target is within range. In this case a target is a"
" yellow ball (Power Cell). There is an analog signal that gives us the "
"location of the ball on one axis of the camera's view. In this case the x or"
" left to right axis."
msgstr ""
"我们从Pixy获得两个信号。一个数字信号告诉我们视野范围内是否有目标——在这个案例中目标指的是黄色的球（2020赛季得分物）。另一个模拟信号告诉我们视野中的球在某个轴上的位置——在这个案例中是x轴。"

"The Pixy's analog signal is from 0 to 3.3 volts with 0 being the leftmost "
"view of the camera. We determined the center of the camera's view to be what"
" we wanted to lock in on. We created a positioning loop that took over the "
"rotational control and calculated the error between the target and the "
"center of the camera. The error was used to calculate our desired yaw until "
"the digital signal showed no more target."
msgstr ""
"Pixy的模拟信号输出0到3.3伏的电压。其中0伏代表摄像头视野内的最左端。在这个案例中，我们希望得分物处在视野的最中央。为此，我们创建一个定位进程来接管driver的旋转输入并计算目标与摄像头视野中央的偏移量。我们用偏移量来计算我们需要的旋转速度，直到数字信号告诉我们视野内没有更多目标了"
