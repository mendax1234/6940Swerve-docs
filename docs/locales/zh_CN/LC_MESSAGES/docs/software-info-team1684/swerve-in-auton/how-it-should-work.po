"We want to tell the robot to go to a coordinate on the field and face a "
"specific direction when it gets there. Sometimes we want the rotation to "
"happen at different places along the route. Sometimes we want it to rotate "
"first or last. Sometimes we even want the robot to travel around an "
"obstacle. The robot should switch modes as desired along the overall route "
"to achieve the game objectives. We used a case generator to give us each "
"motion in the desired order and change states primarily by sensors. The end "
"result should be a robot that travels at the maximum controllable speed "
"while achieving the desired positions with maximum accuracy."
