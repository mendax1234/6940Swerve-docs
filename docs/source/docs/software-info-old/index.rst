Overview
------------
New in the 2020 season, WPILib has some swerve classes available. We did not use these classes.
We do not know how well they work when they are properly implemented. If you decide to try using
these classes, your results may vary.

There was a brief period of time that we attempted to use one of these classes, but we quickly
opted to write our own. For the purposes of future debugging, we wanted to understand every bit of
our code.

Throughout our adventures down the path of swerve, we discovered many useful resources. One of
the most important things we found was this Chief Delphi post .
We used SwerveTester_8.xls to understand how each wheel reacts with different inputs and to
verify our teleop swerve control was working properly.
