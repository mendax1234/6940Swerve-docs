"We DON’T want to deter you from achieving your dream machine. We DO want to "
"limit the number of broken-down robots on the field. As FRC Team 1684's "
"drive coach Jon Uren says, “Build within your means.” If your team doesn’t "
"meet all the requirements listed above, please reconsider attempting to do "
"swerve. Poorly implemented swerve (in both a programming and mechanical "
"sense) will do your team a major disservice. Sure, that robot might look "
"cool or sound epic. But, does it work!? Most of the time, the simpler the "
"better."

"我们并没有阻止你去做出一个理想的机器。我们仅仅想减少在比赛场上坏掉的机器的数量。 正如FRC Team 1684 "
"的驾驶教练所说，“在你的能力范围之内设计并搭建机器。”如果你的队伍并没有满足上述列出的所有要求，请再三考虑你们是否要做Swerve。一个不好的Swerve（无论是在程序还是机械方面）不仅不会提升你们队伍的实力，反而会帮倒忙。的确，用Swerve的机器确实看起来很酷并且听起来很厉害。但是，他们的机器究竟能否正常运行起来！？很多时候，越是简单的机器，效果往往越好。"

"We all know that time on the robot is limited. Programmers always wish for "
"more time on the finished robot. Time is the most valuable build season "
"commodity. Before something does not go as planned, it should be part of "
"your programming strategy to know when to reach out for help. Help can mean "
"looking for sample code, asking on a forum if someone has had a similar "
"issue, or even reaching out to other teams to review your code. Remember "
"that other FRC programmers will likely be in the same semi-frantic state "
"that you are trying to figure out the one thing that isn’t working. Someone "
"outside of your programming team may not have the time to help you. Asking "
"for another team’s time during build season is a BIG ASK!"
