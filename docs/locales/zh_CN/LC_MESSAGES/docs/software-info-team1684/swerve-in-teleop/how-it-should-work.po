"You move the controller and the robot magically does what you think it "
"should. Isn't that the goal? Of course it is! The way that we chose is the "
"same way that our driver would operate a drone. Although, we have not worked"
" out the levitate functionality."

"Given the extra freedom that swerve gives the robot, both literally and in "
"terms of holonomic movement (can freely move in any direction, ideally with "
"no preferred direction), operating in a field-centric manner is immensely "
"helpful. We consider field-centric motion essential to utilizing swerve "
"effectively at a competition level."

"机器人因为swerve底盘而获得了(向各个方向移动)的自由。在这种条件下，采用以场地为参照系的操控方式是极其有效的。我们认为以场地为中心的操纵方式对于在比赛中高效地旋转车体至关重要。"
