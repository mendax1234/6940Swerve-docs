"One of the core differences when operating in autonomous mode is that the "
"robot can't receive information about where it is from the driver, in the "
"form of controls. Early on, we established that we want to accurately and "
"repeatably control our movements and actions. To do this, the robot needs to"
" know where it is at all times - or at least have a good guess. This is "
"known as `odometry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry>`_ within the "
"field of robotics. Without accurate odometry, we're forced to use `dead "
"reckoning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning>`_ , or worse, time-"
"based movements at approximate speeds."

"自动模式下的移动与手动模式下最核心的区别就在于自动模式下的机器人不能从driver那里获得任何信息。因此，为了可以精确地并且重复地控制机器人的移动与动作，机器人需要知道它在赛场的何方——或者至少有个大概的猜测。这一过程在机器人的领域中被称为`odometry"
" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry>`_。如果没有办法精确地预测机器人的位置，我们就智能被迫采用 "
"`dead reckoning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning>`_ "
"，即死记硬背法。甚至，我们可能会需要采用基于时间的控制方法"

"In order to perform our odometry, we decided to use our wheel encoders "
"combined with a gyroscope. By performing the reverse of what we do in "
"teleop, which is taking an intended output pose and figuring out what each "
"individual actuator should be doing to achieve that pose. Again, a pose is "
"simply a set of unique characteristics describing the robot's position or "
"motion at an instant in time. By taking information about the velocity and "
"direction of each wheel and combining it using the kinematics we described "
"in section 2.1, we can obtain an overall velocity of the robot in two "
"directions; this is referred to as Forward Kinematics, or FK. By integrating"
" this over time (just multiplying the velocity at this time with the time "
"step of the controller), we can get our position."

"为了执行我们的”odometry\"，我们决定将我们的车轮编码器与陀螺仪相结合。执行与我们在手动控制中所做的反向运动学计算，设定一个预定的输出姿态，并找出每个单独的这轮应该如何运动来实现该姿态。同时，一个姿态只是一组描述机器人在某一瞬间的位置或运动的独特特征。而通过获取每个瞬间各个车轮的速度和方向的信息，并使用我们在第2.1节中描述的运动学进行组合，我们可以得到机器人在两个方向上的整体速度，进而通过对时间积分（只需将此时的速度与控制器的时间步长相乘），得到我们的位置，这一个过程被称为“正向运动学”，即FK"
