Acknowledgements
================

First and foremost, I'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my parents, particularly my father, who have been tremendously supportive of my FRC career!

Secondly, I'd like to express my gratitude to my team mentors, william Guowei and Jingyang Song, who have been extremely helpful to me over the last two years. Furthermore, I want to thank my teammates; it would be impossible to list all of their names, but I want to thank them for their assistance to me and their significant contribution to our team.

In closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who has assisted me with Chief Delphi. I appreciate your gracious professionalism and your encouraging words!

Without them, I may not be able to complete the code testing of our amazing robot in Season 2022. My FRC career would not be as successful without them.
