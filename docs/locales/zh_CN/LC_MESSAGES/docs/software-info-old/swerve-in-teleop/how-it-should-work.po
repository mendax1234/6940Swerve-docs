"You move the controller and the robot magically does what you think it "
"should. Isnâ€™t that the goal? Of course it is! The way that we chose is the "

" out the levitate functionality."

"The robot should be free to move in any direction on the single plane of the"

"Given the extra freedom that swerve gives the robot, both literally and in "
"terms of holonomic movement (can freely move in any direction, ideally with "

"helpful. We consider field-centric motion essential to utilizing swerve "
"effectively at a competition level."
